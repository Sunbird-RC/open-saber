          <p>The lack of access to learning opportunities is a complex and multidimensional problem. It impacts the lives
            of millions of children on a daily basis. In response, Nandan Nilekani, Rohini Nilekani and Shankar Maruwada
            co-founded EkStep, a not-for-profit initiative to gather partners on a universal, collaborative platform to
            reimagine learning opportunities for every child.</p>
